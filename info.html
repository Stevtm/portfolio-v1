                  design a passive exoskeleton that reduces the energy cost of walking. Based on the proposed design, a reduction
                  in mechanical energy cost of 8% is estimated. Current next steps include the creation of a prototype and
                  the conducting of both mechanical and metabolic cost testing.

                <p> In this project, I worked with another biomechanical engineering
                    student and three occupational therapy (OT) students to create a
                    customized ileostomy bag for a client with severe vision impairment. Because
                    the client could not see the ilesostomy bag, she had trouble
                    aligning it properly with the stoma, resulting in unwanted leaking of fluid.
                    IDDOV process was used to acheive six sigma, and the satisfaction of the client.
                    Our solution was to add a medical-grade putty to the
                    backside of the bag, where the stoma is inserted. Becuase the putty was
                    flexible, it created a seal around the stoma, and prevented the leaking of
                    intestinal fluid. It also required less precision than a standard
                    ileostomy bag, so the clients declining vision was less impactful.

                    problem the Tea Room, a local coffee shop, was having with composting their
                    used coffee grounds. While they had possession of vermicomposting bins (wigwams), they
                    were usuccessful in vermicomposting due to the acidic nature of the coffee
                    grounds. This acidity led to the soil in the bin becoming acidic, which made the
                    environment unhabitable for the worms. The solution was for the shop to also compost
                    eggshells and other basic organic products along with the coffee grounds,
                    to balance the pH of the compost.

                I've been using computers since I was 6 years old, and all that time has
                made me pretty good at it. Whether it's using various programs, troubleshooting,
                or knowing about computer hardware, I'm your guy.

                Public speaking has always come easily to me. While I can get a little
                nervous, I'm able to harness those nerves to keep me alert and on my toes.
                I'm confident in front of an audience, and can speak clearly and strongly.

                While I'm relatively new to the world of coding, I find it incredibly
                fascinating. Languages I've used in school include Python, Matlab, and
                Robot C, while in my personal learnings I've used html (with bootstrap), CSS and
                javascript (with JQuery).

                In my time at PnuVax, I was able to gain a wealth of experience with scale-up
                documentation as the company was readying to move from the lab/testing phase
                to the full-scale production phase.

                get where I want to go.

                to design and a portable speaker system, and Siemens NX was used to model
                all parts of a gearbox for 3D printing. I've also used AutoCAD for work with
                P&IDs.

                <p> I'm Steven Maddison and I'm a 4th-year Biomechanical Engineering
                    student at Queen's University. I decided to go into mechanical engineering (and
                    specifically biomechanical) because of a long-standing passion I've had for
                    prostetics and prosthetic technology. Prosthetics are able to dramatically improve
                    a person's quality of life, and it's an emerging and exciting field. I look
                    forward to a future where people with physical disabilities can receieve a
                    replacement that is equal, or even better, than the original, and I want to be
                    a part of bringing that future to the present.
                    <br><br>
                    My hobbies include reading books, playing basketball ... or pretty much any
                    other sport, as well as singing and playing guitar (occasionally both at once!). I am extremely
                    curious and spend a significant amount of my time searching for answers to questions
                    that randomly pop into my head. I believe that knowledge is power, and I try to live my life accordingly.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a very honest person, and open to construtive criticism.
                    I'm level-headed under pressure, and am able
                    to make the right decision when the times get tough. I am an extremely fast learner,
                    and I pride myself on being able to pick up just about anything if I'm given a little
                    time to practice it. Professionally, I'm a good team player, and I'm
                    willing to go above and beyond to get the job done.
